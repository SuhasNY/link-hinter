# Link-Hinter

**Link-Hinter** is a Chrome extension that lets you navigate and open webpage links using just your keyboard. It is built for speed, efficiency, and keyboard-centric browsing — no mouse required.

## Key Features

- 🔠 Displays short, two-character codes next to up to 150 visible links.
- ⌨️ Activate with a keyboard shortcut (default: `Ctrl+Shift+L`).
- 🚀 Type the code to open the corresponding link in a new tab.
- ⛔ Press `Esc` or re-trigger the shortcut to cancel the overlay.
- ⚠️ Invalid inputs trigger a subtle, non-intrusive popup.

## How to Use It

1. Navigate to any webpage.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+L` to activate Link Hinter.
3. Two-letter codes will appear next to the clickable links.
4. Type the code (e.g. `aa`, `bc`) to instantly open that link in a new tab.
5. Press `Esc` or type an invalid code to cancel the overlay.
